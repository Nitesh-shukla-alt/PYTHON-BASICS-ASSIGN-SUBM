    "\"\"\"Q1-What is Python, and why is it popular \n",
    "\n",
    "ANS\n",
    "Python is a high-level, general-purpose programming language known for its clear syntax and readability\n",
    "    and following reasons are also very important\n",
    "Ease of Learning: Python reads almost like plain English, which makes it perfect for beginners.\n",
    "\n",
    "Versatile Applications: It’s used for web development, data analysis, machine learning, automation, app development, and more.\n",
    "\n",
    "Massive Community: Tons of support, tutorials, and libraries from millions of Pythonistas worldwide.\n",
    "\n",
    "Rich Libraries: Frameworks like Django (for web), Pandas (for data), and TensorFlow (for AI) speed up development.\n",
    "\n",
    "Cross-Platform: Write your code once and run it on Windows, Mac, or Linux.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Q2. What is an Interpreter in Python?\n",
    "Python uses an interpreter, which reads and executes code line by line.\n",
    "\n",
    "It converts Python code into machine instructions during runtime.\n",
    "\n",
    "Great for debugging because it runs immediately and shows errors on the spot.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Q3. What are Pre-defined Keywords in Python?\n",
    "Keywords are reserved words that Python uses to define syntax and structure.\n",
    "\n",
    "Examples include: if, else, elif, for, while, True, False, None, def, class.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q4. Can Keywords Be Used as Variable Names?\n",
    "Nope! You cannot use keywords as variable names.\n",
    "\n",
    "Doing so causes a SyntaxError. For example, if = 5 is invalid.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q5. What is Mutability in Python?\n",
    "Mutability refers to whether an object can be changed after it's created.\n",
    "\n",
    "Mutable objects can be modified (e.g., lists).\n",
    "\n",
    "Immutable objects cannot be modified (e.g., strings, tuples).\n",
    "\n",
    "Q6. Why Are Lists Mutable, But Tuples Are Immutable?\n",
    "Lists: Built to be flexible—elements can be added, changed, or removed.\n",
    "\n",
    "Tuples: Designed for integrity—once created, their contents are fixed.\n",
    "\n",
    "This distinction allows tuples to be used as keys in dictionaries, unlike lists.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q7. What Is the Difference Between “==” and “is” Operators?\n",
    "Operator\tMeaning\tExample\n",
    "==\tChecks if values are equal\ta == b → True if values match\n",
    "is\tChecks if objects are identical\ta is b → True if same memory\n",
    "\n",
    "Q8. What Are Logical Operators in Python?\n",
    "They’re used to combine conditional statements:\n",
    "\n",
    "and: True if both conditions are True.\n",
    "\n",
    "or: True if at least one condition is True.\n",
    "\n",
    "not: Reverses the result (True → False, False → True).\n",
    "\n",
    "Q9. What Is Type Casting in Python?\n",
    "It means converting one data type into another.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example: int(\"5\") → converts string \"5\" to integer 5.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q10. Difference Between Implicit and Explicit Type Casting\n",
    "Type\tDescription\tExample\n",
    "Implicit\tPython automatically converts types\t3 + 2.0 → 5.0\n",
    "Explicit\tProgrammer manually converts types using functions\tfloat(3) → 3.0\n",
    "\n",
    "Q11. What Is the Purpose of Conditional Statements?\n",
    "They guide the flow of your program based on conditions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Allow decision-making using if, elif, else.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q12. How Does the elif Statement Work?\n",
    "Stands for \"else if\".\n",
    "\n",
    "Used when you want multiple conditions:\"\"\"\n",
    "\n",
